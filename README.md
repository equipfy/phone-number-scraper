# Phone Number Scraper
A hacky way to scrape phone numbers from a website.
The text scraped is not "cleaned". So you might find weird long spaces, or characters such as `\t`.

## How to run
To run the project, you would only need to have NodeJS.

- Clone the repo.  
- Go to the repo and run `npm install`.  
- Once done, you can simply run `node index`.  
- By default, that will scrape 0 websites. To add websites, you simply add them as an argument to the command line.  
  - e.g: `node index example.com example2.com`.
